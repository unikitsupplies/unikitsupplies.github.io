            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Nine years ago, two female best friends embarked on a journey to start a business during their campus days. What began as a means to earn extra cash soon 
                became a testament to their friendship and entrepreneurial spirit.</p> 
            <p> As time passed, the business was passed down to two sisters currently pursuing their 
                studies at JKUAT. For them, Unikit Supplies isn't just about paying school fees—it's about thriving in campus life and supporting themselves through their 
                academic journey. </p>

            <p> As each chapter unfolds, Unikit Supplies continues to evolve. With a commitment to quality and a deep understanding of the needs of JKUAT comrades,
                we ensure that the best technical gear is delivered promptly. Our products are crafted to endure your entire campus journey—whether it's four, five,
                or six years—and can even be cherished and passed down through generations.</p>

            <p>
               As the last of them graduates in 2028, the legacy of Unikit Supplies will live on,
                embodying the spirit of camaraderie and entrepreneurship that defines our community.</p>
